                    <p><span style="font-size:32px"><strong>Ebola</strong></span> Virus Disease was first seen in Central Africa and South Sudan in 1976. Now the virus is rapidly spreading throughout West Africa. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most prominent symptoms of Ebola are headaches, intense fever, muscle pain, diarrhea, and general weakness. It is not yet known where Ebola is manifested. Many scientists suspect that the virus is spread when a human comes into contact with an infected animal. Once a human has picked up the virus, it is passed on from person to person through bodily fluids. CNN reported that the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Ministry of Health informed the World Health Organization of strong Ebola outbreaks throughout the country on August 26th, 2014. By September 10th, there had already been 62 cases of Ebola and 35 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. Since then, Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Gabon, South Sudan, Ivory Coast, Uganda, the Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. Guinea has reported 494 deaths, Liberia has had 871 deaths, Nigeria has seen 7 deaths, and Sierra Leone has counted 476 deaths. However, in all of West Africa there has been over 2,400 people reported dead because of Ebola. The WHO declared the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic “...the worst outbreak in the four-decade history of tracking the disease.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that there is no vaccine that can fight off Ebola. However, medical rituals such as providing intravenous IV fluids, maintaining blood pressure and oxygen status, and treating infections as they occur can all slow down the symptoms and increase survival rates. People who do recover from the virus tend to have stronger immune systems. If someone already has Ebola antibodies is their system, it is more likely that their body will fight off the disease.</p>

                    <blockquote>“...the <span style="font-size:32px"><strong>worst outbreak</strong></span> in the four-decade history of tracking the disease.”</blockquote>

                    <p>The lack of treatments available has not stopped African leaders from enforcing preventive measures. CNN reported that Ellen Johnson, Liberia’s president, imposed a nationwide curfew and ordered two communities to be quarantined in late August. Sierra Leone’s government issued a nationwide lockdown from September 19th to the 21st. African treatment facilities are overflowing with patients, and resources are starting to disappear. President Barack Obama has reacted to the Ebola outbreaks by asking Congress to approve additional funding for his efforts. So far, the American government has donated 400,000 treatment kits, money for treatment centers, and has built a training facility where thousands of healthcare workers are learning to treat Ebola infected patients. The bottom line is that the virus is continuing to spread, people are dying every day, and if we want to safeguard the future of the human race, then we need to use all of our resources in order to stop this deadly virus once and for all. </p>
