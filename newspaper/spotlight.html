                    <h1 style="text-align: center"><em>An Interview with Beth Bolinger</em></h1>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 32px"><strong>Everyone knows Beth Bolinger</strong></span> as the C-wing SLC on third floor, but not many students neither know about her pastimes nor her educational background. After sitting down with Beth for an interview, I learned more about her in thirty minutes than I did over the course of my junior year. I first asked her about how she found the Indiana Academy. She replied, “I was living in Muncie and had been for several years, and I was looking for jobs at Ball State. I saw a lot of jobs where I thought, ‘Well, I could do that job, but it’s not necessarily something I’m interested in doing…’ I happened to look at the professional page, and I saw the SLC job. I thought, ‘This job fits me perfectly…’”.</p>
                    <p>After going through a four-hour interview for the SLC position, she was turned down. Luckily for us, Beth was tenacious enough to apply a second time, and she was hired. When I was done asking questions about her career at the Indiana Academy, I inquired about her education. Ms. Bolinger has a bachelor’s degree in Applied Voice from Indiana Wesleyan University. Because most Indiana Academy students, both juniors and seniors, are starting to look at colleges, I asked Beth what criteria attracted her to Indiana Wesleyan University. “I wanted to be far enough away from home that I wouldn’t be driving home every weekend but close enough that I could drive home if I needed to,” explained Beth. She also commented on the squeaky clean facilities and large dormitories present at the university. </p>
                    <p>Further into the interview, we started chatting about her area of study: music. Beth described the uncertainty she felt when choosing a major, saying that she chose a degree when she didn’t have enough interest in any particular subject to do so. However, Ms. Bolinger has future educational plans that can use her four year degree; she elaborated, “The degree is basically just a stepping stone for me… Because I have a bachelor’s degree, I can apply for a master’s (degree) in a field that I’m interested in….” Beth plans on obtaining a master’s degree in student affairs and working with college students in dormitories as a residential advisor. </p>
                    <p>We also discussed about her experience teaching English in South Korea. Not only did Beth go into great detail about her actual teaching job, but she also described the dazzling culture in Busan. “...I lived about a thirty minute bus ride from the beach. It was lovely to go there… You could always find another English speaker,” said Beth. She also commented on how Western culture had spread to Busan. She stated that there were McDonald’s and Burger King restaurants all over the place. The students in that region would go to school for eight hours a day, and then they would go to a “hagwon.”</p>
                    <p>Hagwons are private institutes found in South Korea that tutor students in specific subjects. Beth worked in a hagwon that focused on English. “…I knew very little Korean. There were two teachers. The main teacher would teach vocabulary and grammar, and then what I would do as a native English speaker, I would teach pronunciation and conversation skills,” Beth said as she described her job in Korea.</p>
                    <p>My last question for Beth was, “If you had a piece of advice for today’s high school graduates, what would it be?” She replied, “Find what you’re passionate about and chase after that with your entire being.”</p>

                     <h1 style="text-align: center">An Essay by Ms. Kim Foltz</h1>
                     <p>If you are looking to find me on the first Saturday of any given month, more often than not the right place to look would be The Waters, a nursing home in nearby Yorktown.  I spend an hour or so there once a month, participating in a music service and interacting with the residents informally before and after.  This ministry began about 15 years ago when a friend of mine from my church suggested to a group of us that we doing something like this to try to have a positive impact in our local community.</p>
                     <p>The service is pretty simple.  We just sit intermixed with the residents in sort of a circle and sing some of their favorite hymns.  Before and after the service time, we just hang out with the residents, talking to them and helping those who need assisted in traveling back to their rooms.  There is nothing fancy about what we do while we are there, but the residents seem to look forward to our visits.  We also look to do some special events with the residents from time to time.  Each December, we do a Christmas program that includes carols, refreshments, and a few games.  No matter what the month, we always enjoy a chance to celebrate and share the good news of the gospel of Jesus.</p>
                     <p>I try to do my best to learn and remember the names of the residents, but I have to admit that I don’t always do well at that with a month in between visits.  When stumped when trying to mention something that happened with one of the residents, my friends and I will sometimes joke and say, “you know…the one with the white hair and glasses.”    Still, we have gotten to know several of the residents pretty well over the years.  One of the residents, Martha, was coming up on her 90th birthday.  She had mentioned it for a few months leading up to her birthday month, so we went to see her on the day of her birthday and took a cake.  We go each month with the hope of encouraging the residents, but it always manages to be an uplifting experience for us also.</p>
                     <p>When we originally started doing services at the nursing home, we typed up songs in 20 point font, assembled them in folders, and created our own song books for use at the nursing home.  We have been using them ever since.  Actually, though, most of the residents don’t need the song books.  These are the songs that they have sung all of their lives, so they pretty much know them by heart.  I enjoy a variety of music styles personally.  However, there really is something special about these songs, so I enjoy still getting to sing them.  Hymns have a depth to them because they are so rich in theological truths.</p>
                     <p>While I grew up singing many of these songs, I don’t always get to hear them very often now.  However, they still speak to me.  For example, on my first trip to the nursing home after I broke my ankle this summer, one of the residents requested the hymn “Great is Thy Faithfulness.”  I was really encouraged by the last verse of this song:</p>
                     <blockquote>
                     			Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,</br>
								Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;</br>
								Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,</br>
								Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
					</blockquote>
					<p>I had been sort of discouraged at about that point in my recovery process, but the truth of that verse really hit me.  It reminded me, as a follower of Christ, that because of what Jesus accomplished with his death and resurrection I am promised that I will have the strength I need for today and even more so I have a hope for tomorrow that transcends whatever circumstances I might be facing.  The hymn expressed these great ideas in an eloquent and poetic manner.  I am a math teacher; I am not usually one for sitting down and reading poetry.  However, I guess hymns are my form of poetry.  </p>
					<p>If any students are interested in community service and would enjoy singing classic hymns, let me know some month.  We would be glad to have you along.  It will bring a smile to some local senior citizens, and it might just bring a smile to you, too.</p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">Faculty Spotlight Interview: Miss Foltz</h1>
					<p><span style ="font-size: 32px"><strong>W153 – </strong></span>Although mathematics may not be everyone’s forte here at the Academy, Miss Foltz certainly possesses strength in teaching Academites math through creative and innovative methods. She has a knack for helping her students succeed in all areas of their lives, and it is not uncommon for students to get to know her outside of the classroom and maintain contact even after graduation.  </p>
					<p>As she has over two decades of teaching at the Academy under her belt now, she still continues to enjoy, tackle, and embrace the new experiences and journeys that come her way as an academic advisor, the Academy Bible Study sponsor, and a teacher. In the spring of ’91, having recently graduated with a master’s degree in mathematics from BSU, she pursued a career in teaching</p>
					<p>When asked in what ways the Academy appealed to her, Miss Foltz replied, “It is a good teaching environment; students are interested in being in class and learning. It is not a battle to get them to sit down and listen. Discipline in that manner is not necessary, and it is not my forte or interest to do so, either. I enjoy having the ability to teach with the students being involved.  The Academy is the only school at which I have taught, and I just can’t imagine teaching anywhere else.”  </p>
					<p>Interestingly enough, AP Calculus AB and BC have not been the only classes she has taught here.  “I taught elementary analysis, which is now known as precalculus. Over the years, I taught statistics, finite math, and the regular calculus course,” Miss Foltz said about her other experiences. “Now, I teach both AP courses. AB is what I have taught the most, and I really enjoy it.  I have found it to be a comfortable pace for students and not too overwhelming.  The students have done well with the course.” </p>
					<blockquote> "The Academy is the only school at which I have taught, and I just can’t imagine teaching anywhere else.”</blockquote>
					<p>When asked about her favorite quote, she responded, “It usually depends on the context. I usually go with one that fits the situation. I like lots of quotes from great theologians. As far as applying to math and teaching, I had a math professor that said, ‘Math is not a spectator sport.’ You can’t just sit there and watch me teach. You should ask yourself questions and interact with it more than watch me work the problems. I already know how to work the problems.” </p>
					<p>Outside of the walls of Wagoner and Burris, Miss Foltz leads an equally active life.  </p>
					<p>“Summer, I like to swim. I enjoy hanging out with friends, watching and enjoying some sports like basketball, taking part in church activities, and doing things with family”, she shared about her time outside of school. She also enjoys chances to travel.  The most adventuresome place she has visited is Japan, a fourteen hour journey.</p>
					<p>Like many Academites Miss Foltz has her own indulgences like TV, eateries, and more. As far as TV is concerned she expressed, “I really like the show 24 when it played a few years back. They did a summer comeback season recently. I like a rich plot full of drama and action. Although it is hard to grade papers when the plot is so dramatic and full of action. I used to like NCIS but they have kind of lost it at this point.” She shared her favorite food and restaurant as a Muncie local. “I like lots of places, and I’m easy to please but finicky. I like Pizza King; it’s a Muncie classic and local favorite. Ham and barbecue or sausage and pepperoni with extra cheese are good choices. Of course, Pizza King is a bit over-priced so that’s the down side. In general, I like barbecue and pizza, so I guess that’s why I like ham and barbecue. If it’s food I usually don’t have a problem.” </p>
					<p>As the interview was being held, the popular and incessantly in-demand Miss Foltz was also helping junior Peter Shirk with homework questions. This kind of juggling multiple tasks is not rare, however, as “multitasking happens a lot in this office.”  When asked to describe the most rewarding experience she has had as a teacher she pointed out, “I enjoy working with students each day as there is something new and interesting going on. It is rewarding in various ways overall; there is not one specific highlight. Being involved with the Academy Bible Study is the best part of my job. I really enjoy how it allows me to interact with students in a different realm.” </p>
					<p>Suddenly Shirk excitedly exclaimed, “Ah, now I understand derivatives!” 
					Miss Foltz laughingly said, “This is a rewarding moment.”

					<h1 style="text-align: center">Mr. Schuh: a Man of Kinematics and Cuban Hats </h1>
					<p><em>The following is an interview of Mr. Schuh, a physics teacher here at the Academy. It took place September 15, 2014 in his small office by Elliott tunnel. The questions asked were requested by students at the Academy.</em> </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>: What majors have you studied?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:I was an art major, an English major, a history major, a math major (which should be a surprise to everyone actually), and then finally a physics major. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:How interesting. So, how many years have you been teaching?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:This is my fifteenth year at the Academy, but I’ve taught and assisted with teaching for about 26 years.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:Wow! If you weren’t teaching physics, what would you be doing?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:Selling kumquats in Mexico.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What is the hardest part about teaching?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:Here, I think part of the hardest part is trying to stay ahead of the Academites.  They ask very good questions and a lot of times there aren’t canned answers. Thinking on my feet and trying to remember everything I’ve ever learned all at once to formulate an answer to a good question isn’t easy. Fortunately, questions tend to repeat themselves. In this case, all I have to do is give my answer more eloquently. Also, the Academy has the red tapes of high schools and colleges, so there is a lot of bureaucracy you have to work through to get things done. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:Do you have a favorite book? Why do you like it?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:As of now, it’s <span style="text-decoration: underline">Anathem</span> by Neal Stephenson. I like it for two reasons. One, it is the best book about nothing happening I’ve ever read. Two, it is indirectly about Academites.  Read it. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:Are there any current developments in your field that you are interested in?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:Part of the problem about having so many majors is I have way too many interests. I deal with physics a lot here so I don’t really think about it outside of work. Other than the obvious <em>entropy</em> answer, I like the high-end Biophysics with all the prosthetics, the research going into neurocybernetics, and cosmology, which really ties into <em>entropy</em>. Other than that, I’m really interested in Mesopotamian history and keep up on most archeological finds.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What made you want to study physics?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:I was mediocre in everything and my internal joke was if I’m going to be mediocre in something, it might as well be something everyone thinks is really hard. When I started, I realized that physics required a type of thinking that I had never had to do before. It caused me to think better, not just more.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:So now for the more pressing matters. How long have you been growing your hair out?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:I started growing it out at nineteen and cut it all off at 21. Then, I let it grow out until I started working with the fire department at 24. Since then, every four or five years, I lop off six inches.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:Do you ever wear it down?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:All the time, just not here. No one here deserves it. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:So, how many hair ties have you been through?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:A billion. I lose them all the time.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:How about hats?</p>
					<p><strong>Schuh</strong>:It’s really hard for me to find hats since I have a giant, Viking-shovel head. I only like the Castro hats which are very hard to find. I have two that are falling apart completely, but I’ve kept them around for the past four years. So if anyone has a giant, extra-large Cuban hat, let me know.</p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">Portrait of Dr. Smith as an English Enthusiast </h1>
					<p><em>The following is an interview of Dr. Smith, an English teacher here at the Academy. It took place September 22, 2014 in her busy office near Elliot Commons. The questions asked were requested by students at the Academy.</em></p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:Which colleges/universities have you attended?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:I did my undergraduate work at Hampshire College in Massachusetts, and then transferred from there to the University of Massachusetts for my graduate work. I also studied for a year in Germany at Freiburg University.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:How interesting! What degrees have you received?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:I have a B.A. in philosophy and a Masters and a PhD in English.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:How long have you taught?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:Approximately 20 years; this is my fourteenth year here at the Academy. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What do you like to do?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:I like to take walks, read books, and sit around with those I love.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:You say you like to read; are there any books that mean a lot to you?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:I have quite a few. . . James Joyce’s <em>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>. . . . Edna O’Brien’s three novel work <em>The Country Girls</em> really knocked me out, I loved it. . . . and I used to love reading the Iris Murdoch novels that came out every year.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What do you think it takes to make a good book?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:The prose has to be strong; it cannot be lazily or sloppily written. It has to take me into a world that I like being in, which is why I am so drawn to Irish and British works. Finally it has to have texture. Sometimes you read a book that has good, reasonable sentences but feels flat. It needs the texture of life.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What is your favorite part about working at the Academy?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:There are so many.  First off, my students. I thought I’d died and gone to Heaven when I came here and found that everyone really wants to learn. They’re willing to be serious, they’re willing to be playful, and they’re willing to work hard and I had not had that experience before. I love the autonomy of the English department in the works that we teach. We get to teach what we find is most important and there is no set list of important books . . . there are so many and we get to choose. And my colleagues are so delightful and we amuse each other a lot. </p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:What is the hardest part of teaching?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:It never stops during the school year. We do get great vacations (summers are wonderful), but during the school year, nights, weekends . . . it goes on and on.</p>
					<p><strong>IASMHI</strong>:To wrap up, what do you believe the most important thing about learning English (grammar, literature, etc.) is?</p>
					<p><strong>Smith</strong>:That is a really good question. It is one I often talk about with my American Literature students because they’re in a class that everyone is required to take, yet not everyone likes it. Of course, what it means to teach English varies a lot. The focus at a lot of American high schools, including the Academy, is on reading literature and talking about ideas. There are some other approaches that focus more on grammar and writing, and I think that all of these things are important. I believe that it helps to develop people’s ability to think clearly and to develop their thinking to go beyond the surface, to go beyond the kinds of ideas and language that are so readily available through popular culture and the chatty things we say to each other. It takes us to a new form of language and thought, which is really important. Often soldiers who come back from combat have a difficult time adjusting to life at home. I was reading a review of recent collections of stories and one of which was written by someone who served in either Iraq or Afghanistan. One of his stories’ characters returns from combat and sees Americans as fat and lazy people who live meaningless lives. The character even hides in a dressing room whenever he and his wife go out to the mall. What strikes me is all around us there are opportunities to live life intensely and take it seriously, and literature offers that opportunity without having to suffer the horrors of war. For some people, [war] is the introduction to “Oh my gosh, this life is serious and important, and I want to do something worthwhile with it.” Well, literature is one of the things that offers us that chance to recognize all of these imaginative ways people have come to grips with serious questions such as “What am I going to do with my life, and what makes it worthwhile?” </p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">Jo Tuite's Journey </h1>
					<p><em><strong><span style="font-size:32px">Jo Tuite</span></strong></em> works at the Indiana Academy with academy admittance, and I had the privilege to interview her about her life, her duties, and her pleasures. Jo Tuite has been at the Academy since 1991. I asked her how she stays in touch with students and she replied mostly by e-mail, but that there is also an “active social media.”  She can stay in touch with students using Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube, but they are less active. She gave me some information about her family life, including that she has four children. Her youngest is six years old, and she has three adopted children ages eighteen, twenty, and twenty-one. She said at the Academy there is a lot of exciting stuff going on. As soon as the admittance process is over, she makes her way to the new set. She said there are many amazing projects by teachers, like the Plato Trial, and all of the programs put together by the SLCs are very fun and effective. Jo went on to tell me ways students can prosper here at the Academy. The major way is to put academics first; she said, “Academics are second to none.” The student-teacher relationships are amazing, and the opportunities at the Academy are a true prep for college. Jo attended Madison Heights High School in Anderson, a high school which is no longer in existence. She is now busy with studying educational leadership and getting her Ball State doctorate.</p>

					<h1 style="text-align: center">An Interview with Dr.Arnold</h1>
					<p><span style ="font-size:32px"><strong>Dr. Thomas Arnold</strong></span> is well-known around the Indiana Academy for his thoughtful Foundations of the American Experience lectures and his in-depth knowledge of Ancient Greek philosophers, but most students don’t have much insight on his colorful background. Believe it or not, Dr. Arnold always had a strong connection with history. When I asked him if he had ever thought about doing anything other than being a history teacher, he responded by saying, “In retrospect, I was pretty much doomed to be a historian. From boyhood on, I was always interested in history. I won the fourth grade Daughters of the American Revolution history prize, and in college, from early on, I enjoyed my history classes…” Although, at some points in his educational career, he did have a few other occupations in mind. “Growing up, I thought about a lot of different directions. In third grade I wanted to be a marine biologist… At one point, I was very interested in archaeology and the whole Indiana Jones dream. In college, for a while, I thought about being an architecturist...” However, all of these dreams somehow fell short. In response to my question about having any regrets, Dr. Arnold said that he eventually decided that the idea of archaeology being a glamorous career is incorrect, and he absolutely didn’t regret not becoming a marine biologist, because of the “fish smell.” Next, I questioned him on why he decided to start hosting Faculty Film Nights at the Indiana Academy. “One thing I’ve noticed when talking to Academy students is that they haven’t seemed to have seen a lot of movies, a lot of films… It can be entertaining, satisfying; it can be light and lively, but it can also make you think. So I would like to help encourage that,” remarks Dr. Arnold. Another reason, Dr. Arnold started film nights was to teach Indiana Academy students that they should remain “critically engaged” even during their downtime. I went on to ask him about his professional career. Dr. Arnold has a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin College and a PhD from Ohio State. He has taught history at Yale and was a program manager for Teaching at the Alliance for Lifelong Learning in New York City. It was only natural to wonder how on earth he wound up teaching at a small high school in Indiana. “Muncie, Indiana is my wife’s hometown. I’ve been periodically visiting Muncie since before I was married in 1990…” Dr. Arnold goes on to explain that when his prior job at the Alliance for Lifelong Learning ended, he had a lot of decisions to make and plenty of time to make them. He explored different ideas such as traveling around different deserts with his wife and kids, but fate had something else in mind for him. On a trip to visit his wife’s parents, he came across one of his in-laws’ neighbors, who at the time was the director of the Indiana Academy. After a short chat, he was persuaded to do an interview for the job. With much hesitation, Dr. Arnold applied for the position. When he was hired, he imagined it as a short-term job, but ended up enjoying teaching young, gifted students so much that he stayed for over a decade. While we were speaking of his career at the Academy, I asked him what he thought of the proposed history curriculum. He answered that he likes the Foundations of the American Experience curriculum, because he gets to link American history to philosophers and events from around the world. Dr. Arnold stated that isolating American history from other world events doesn’t work in today’s modern schools. Carrying on with the vocational questions, I asked him about his book, The Renaissance at War. The title of the book is self-explanatory; the book is about warfare during the Renaissance era. In the introduction, Dr. Arnold wrote that he was influenced by colleagues, professors, and The Art of War, a book that attempts to reconcile the differences between modern and ancient military practices. I went on to ask him what he specifically found so interesting about warfare. Dr. Arnold answered, “I grew up in a military family. My father was a naval officer… My grandfather, my mother’s father, was a career officer who fought in the First World War and the Second World War. So, I grew up around people and in a family that had and were directly participating in war…” Dr. Arnold also said he finds war fascinating because it’s terrible, yet unavoidable. He even went so far as to call it a “cultural and social disease.” My last question for Dr. Arnold was, “If you could go back in time and tell your eighteen year old self one thing, what would it be?” He answered, “Have more courage in yourself...”</p>
