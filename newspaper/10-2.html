                    <p>Everyone knows Beth Bolinger as the C-wing SLC on third floor, but not many students neither know about her pastimes nor her educational background. After sitting down with Beth for an interview, I learned more about her in thirty minutes than I did over the course of my jjunior year. I first asked her about how she found the Indiana Academy. She replied, “I was living in Muncie and had been for several years, and I was looking for jobs at Ball State. I saw a lot of jobs where I thought, ‘Well, I could do that job, but it’s not necessarily something I’m interested in doing…’ I happened to look at the professional page, and I saw the SLC job. I thought, ‘This job fits me perfectly…’”.
                     After going through a four-hour interview for the SLC position, she was turned down. Luckily for us, Beth was tenacious enough to apply a second time, and she was hired. When I was done asking questions about her career at the Indiana Academy, I inquired about her education. Ms. Bolinger has a bachelor’s degree in Applied Voice from Indiana Wesleyan University. Because most Indiana Academy students, both juniors and seniors, are starting to look at colleges, I asked Beth what criteria attracted her to Indiana Wesleyan University. “I wanted to be far enough away from home that I wouldn’t be driving home every weekend but close enough that I could drive home if I needed to,” explained Beth. She also commented on the squeaky clean facilities and large dormitories present at the university. 
                    Further into the interview, we started chatting about her area of study: music. Beth described the uncertainty she felt when choosing a major, saying that she chose a degree when she didn’t have enough interest in any particular subject to do so. However, Ms. Bolinger has future educational plans that can use her four year degree; she elaborated, “The degree is basically just a stepping stone for me… Because I have a bachelor’s degree, I can apply for a master’s (degree) in a field that I’m interested in….” Beth plans on obtaining a master’s degree in student affairs and working with college students in dormitories as a residential advisor. 
                    We also discussed about her experience teaching English in South Korea. Not only did Beth go into great detail about her actual teaching job, but she also described the dazzling culture in Busan. “...I lived about a thirty minute bus ride from the beach. It was lovely to go there… You could always find another English speaker,” said Beth. She also commented on how Western culture had spread to Busan. She stated that there were McDonald’s and Burger King restaurants all over the place. The students in that region would go to school for eight hours a day, and then they would go to a “hagwon.” 
                    Hagwons are private institutes found in South Korea that tutor students in specific subjects. Beth worked in a hagwon that focused on English. “…I knew very little Korean. There were two teachers. The main teacher would teach vocabulary and grammar, and then what I would do as a native English speaker, I would teach pronunciation and conversation skills,” Beth said as she described her job in Korea. 
                    My last question for Beth was, “If you had a piece of advice for today’s high school graduates, what would it be?” She replied, “Find what you’re passionate about and chase after that with your entire being.”

                    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
