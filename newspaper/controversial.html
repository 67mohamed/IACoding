                    <h1>Medical Marijuana: An Excuse or a Possibility?</h1>
                    <p><span style = "font-size: 32px "><strong>Mary Jane. Weed. Hemp. Hash.</strong></span> Marijuana goes by many names that hold different connotations for users.  More scientific terms, like cannabis, have come into play these last few decades with the rise of medicinal marijuana. Is cannabis a legitimate resource for health care, and should it be allowed on a medical basis?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">For:</h2>
                    <p>First of all, even doctors who do not morally support marijuana use can admit that it has a few good medical properties.  THC, the most common and well-known compound in marijuana, has been available in pill form since the 1980s to reduce nausea and vomiting, and the increased appetite brought on by weed can help AIDS victims gain weight.  Cannabis may even prove useful to cancer victims someday, if they are proven to help reduce the spread of the disease. More avid supporters take marijuana’s medicinal uses a step farther; weed is unofficially used to treat cancer, diabetes, arthritis, insomnia, anxiety, and a whole slew of other diseases and issues.  It is, essentially, a cure-all for physical and mental afflictions. </p>

                    <p>Marijuana is also safer than many prescription painkillers, since it is almost impossible to die from overdosing on cannabis without the aid of other drugs or alcohol.  In fact, a study led by Dr. Marcus Bachhuber of the University of Pennsylvania showed that some states had a 25% drop in painkiller related deaths a few years after legalizing marijuana.  With such a drastic difference right after legalization, it is reasonable to assume that the switch to a less harmful painkiller, cannabis, kept many people from overdosing.  It helps that marijuana users are less likely to form an addiction than tobacco users!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Against:</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Bachhuber’s conclusion is logical based on the research, but there are many unintended side effects and shortcomings to medicinal marijuana.  Different strains of marijuana have different amounts of compounds (called cannabinoids), and each strain contains over 70 active compounds.  This makes isolating specific chemicals for research very difficult.  The cannabinoids that have been tested cause memory and motor impairment, which can worsen over time.  Teens are especially susceptible to negative effects, and heavy use from a young age can stunt brain development.  Unfortunately for cannabis-lovers of all ages, most of the ‘miracle’ treatments are untested, unsupported, and unlikely, and using marijuana in place of actual medical treatment can lead to serious health problems.</p>

                    <p>Cannabis can actually cause a few health problems on its own; the sedative and euphoric properties of medicinal weed may agitate patients rather than reduce their anxiety, and it worsens mental illnesses like schizophrenia.  People with a family history of mental illnesses are discouraged to use medicinal marijuana because it increases their risk of developing the illness.  Many recent studies are now focusing on the possibility of marijuana as an important factor in lung cancer as well, and lung diseases like bronchitis are proven to be an effect of long-term use.  Even low doses for an extended period of time will cause a moderate physiological addiction, and withdrawal symptoms can last from 48-72 hours.  No medicine is without its side effects, but there is too little information on controlling and administering medicinal marijuana to make it safe.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p>Whether you’re a DARE officer, a hemp-toting hippie, or somewhere in between, I hope you realize the importance of marijuana research.  It may turn out to be as incredible as its users claim or it may be useless as anything besides a mild pain reliever, but we’ll never know until we allow scientists to conduct more tests.  Right now it’s difficult for researchers to get their hands on enough marijuana for testing because it’s listed as a Schedule 1 drug: no medicinal value and a high potential for addiction.  Decide for yourself!</p>
