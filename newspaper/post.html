                    <p>Dr. Thomas Arnold is well-known around the Indiana Academy for his thoughtful Foundations of the 

                        American Experience lectures and his in-depth knowledge of Ancient Greek philosophers, but most 

                        students don’t have much insight on his colorful background. Believe it or not, Dr. Arnold always had a 

                        strong connection with history. When I asked him if he had ever thought about doing anything other 

                        than being a history teacher, he responded by saying, “In retrospect, I was pretty much doomed to be a 

                        historian. From boyhood on, I was always interested in history. I won the fourth grade Daughters of the 

                        American Revolution history prize, and in college, from early on, I enjoyed my history classes...” 

                        Although, at some points in his educational career, he did have a few other occupations in mind. 

                        <blockquote>“Growing up, I thought about a lot of different directions. In third grade I wanted to be a marine 

                        biologist... At one point, I was very interested in archaeology and the whole Indiana Jones dream. In 

                        college, for a while, I thought about being an architecturist...” </blockquote>However, all of these dreams somehow 

                        fell short. In response to my question about having any regrets, Dr. Arnold said that he eventually 

                        decided that the idea of archaeology being a glamorous career is incorrect, and he absolutely didn’t 

                        regret not becoming a marine biologist, because of the “fish smell.” Next, I questioned him on why he 

                        decided to start hosting Faculty Film Nights at the Indiana Academy. “One thing I’ve noticed when 

                        talking to Academy students is that they haven’t seemed to have seen a lot of movies, a lot of films... It 

                        can be entertaining, satisfying; it can be light and lively, but it can also make you think. So I would like to 

                        help encourage that,” remarks Dr. Arnold. Another reason, Dr. Arnold started film nights was to teach 

                        Indiana Academy students that they should remain “critically engaged” even during their downtime. I 

                        went on to ask him about his professional career. Dr. Arnold has a bachelor’s degree from Oberlin 

                        College and a PhD from Ohio State. He has taught history at Yale and was a program manager for 

                        Teaching at the Alliance for Lifelong Learning in New York City. It was only natural to wonder how on 

                        earth he wound up teaching at a small high school in Indiana. “Muncie, Indiana is my wife’s hometown. 

                        I’ve been periodically visiting Muncie since before I was married in 1990...” Dr. Arnold goes on to explain 

                        that when his prior job at the Alliance for Lifelong Learning ended, he had a lot of decisions to make and 

                        plenty of time to make them. He explored different ideas such as traveling around different deserts with 

                        his wife and kids, but fate had something else in mind for him. On a trip to visit his wife’s parents, he 

                        came across one of his in-laws’ neighbors, who at the time was the director of the Indiana Academy. 

                        After a short chat, he was persuaded to do an interview for the job. With much hesitation, Dr. Arnold 

                        applied for the position. When he was hired, he imagined it as a short-term job, but ended up enjoying 

                        teaching young, gifted students so much that he stayed for over a decade. While we were speaking of 

                        his career at the Academy, I asked him what he thought of the proposed history curriculum. He 

                        answered that he likes the Foundations of the American Experience curriculum, because he gets to link 

                        American history to philosophers and events from around the world. Dr. Arnold stated that isolating 

                        American history from other world events doesn’t work in today’s modern schools. Carrying on with the 

                        vocational questions, I asked him about his book, The Renaissance at War. The title of the book is self-
                        explanatory; the book is about warfare during the Renaissance era. In the introduction, Dr. Arnold wrote 

                        that he was influenced by colleagues, professors, and The Art of War, a book that attempts to reconcile 

                        the differences between modern and ancient military practices. I went on to ask him what he specifically 

                        found so interesting about warfare. Dr. Arnold answered, “I grew up in a military family. My father was a 

                        naval officer... My grandfather, my mother’s father, was a career officer who fought in the First World 

                        War and the Second World War. So, I grew up around people and in a family that had and were directly 

                        participating in war...” Dr. Arnold also said he finds war fascinating because it’s terrible, yet unavoidable. 

                        He even went so far as to call it a “cultural and social disease.” My last question for Dr. Arnold was, “If 

                        you could go back in time and tell your eighteen year old self one thing, what would it be?” He 

                        answered, “Have more courage in yourself...”</p>
