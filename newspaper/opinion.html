                    <h1 style="text-alignment: center">Scots Reject Independence Referendum</h1>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 32px"><strong><em>On September 18th,</em></strong></span> the Scottish people voted on a referendum that threatened to tear the United Kingdom apart. This crucial referendum asked the Scottish people to vote on the future independence of their country.</p>
                    <p>To most Americans, the idea of a province seceding from its country seems impossible, but Scotland is far more unique than most provinces due to its unique political history. The idea of Scotland leaving the United Kingdom is not new, and has in fact been a question since the inception of this union in 1707 between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. Up until this point, the terms “British” and “Scottish” meant very different things, representing different national identities and cultures. Despite a political union with Britain, the Scottish national identity did not disappear. Instead, it persisted throughout the centuries into the present day. Due to these differences in culture and national identity, the question of Scottish independence has always lingered.</p>
                    <p>This question has arisen and subsided for generations, and has come to a boiling point once more. One of the major political parties in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP), has made Scottish independence its primarily political philosophy, while other parties within Scotland took a pro-UK stance. After years of debate, it was decided to hold an independence referendum, which looked to settle the massive political debate, at least for a generation.</p>
                    <p>This particular iteration of the Scottish independence movement was faced with many issues, some far beyond the realm of politics. Economists raised many questions about the financial well-being of the new state, and it was speculated that any new Scottish state could fail financially within a few years of its inception. These questions, and others, lingered heavily on the minds of voters as the polls opened on September 18th. </p>
                    <p>As the votes were counted and tabulated, and the figures released, one answer became clear: Scotland was not going to leave the United Kingdom. The pro-UK opposition won; 55% of all of the votes were against secession. But simultaneously, 45% of the votes were in favor of secession. This slim 10% margin was far too narrow to settle the question for a generation, as was hoped. In fact, it is already clear that it has failed in this regard: a wave of new memberships to the pro-independence SNP occurred in the days after the results were announced. It is apparent that the struggle will persist, even if it does subside for now.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, the results of this referendum lead only to more questions. While it is now clear that, at least for the time being, Scotland will remain in the United Kingdom; the status of the entire system still hangs in the balance, as the referendum causes new debate on voting procedures, home rule, and the power of Scotland within the UK. These questions will perhaps be answered in time, but at least for the moment, the whole of the United Kingdom faces a murky and undermined future.</p>

                    <h1 style="text-alignment: center">Apple’s New Products</h1>
                    <p>On September 9th, Apple held its annual keynote address, one of two times during the year that new products are introduced. This year, they did not disappoint. As well as an update to the iPhone line, Apple released a new mobile operating system, a system of payment via mobile devices, and a brand new wearable called Apple Watch </p>
                    <p>The latest generation of iPhone has two models, the 6 and 6+. Both dwarf in size of all previous iPhone models: the iPhone 5 has a 4” diagonal screen while iPhone 6 has 4.7” and 6+ has 5.5”. The iPhone 6+ boasts a resolution of 1920×1080. That’s the same as my 2008 iMac. As Eli Hodapp, the editor in chief for the tech blog TouchArcade, put it,</p>
                    <blockquote>“The iPhone 6 Plus will play games in higher resolution than next generation consoles. Think about that for a minute.”</blockquote>
                    <p>Both models of iPhone come with improved cameras and wireless capabilities. The new iPhones also come with iOS 8, which introduces Apple Pay. Apple Pay uses an NFC antenna, so users do not even have to open applications or even wake the phone. Instead, Apple Pay uses Touch ID.  Furthermore, the new iPhones have significant changes to the camera including aperture and shutter controls. The CPU is to be about 25%. Perhaps the most significant portion of the keynote was the unveiling of Apple’s new wearable, the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch, which comes in three  styles and two sizes, is a small touch screen device designed to be worn on the wrist and used in conjunction with other Apple devices. Somewhat disappointingly to many Apple users, the Apple Watch requires tethering to a smartphone, which to many appears illogical given a $349 price tag. The iPhone 6 starts at $199 and the 6+ at $299.</p>
